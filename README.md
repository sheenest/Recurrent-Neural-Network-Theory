# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Theory
SUTD 40.319 Statistical and Machine Learning 1D Project \n
In this project, we looked into theory of Recurrent Neural Network and explored applications of RNN and LSTM in stock price prediction.  
I focused more on the theory, in terms of the Architecture of RNN models, and the mathematics and algorithm of Back Propogation Through Time(BPTT), for the training of RNN Models.  

# Instructions
Simple download and open 'RecurrentNeuralNetwork.html' to view the project report.  
To run the code, first ensure RStudio is installed. Then, open 'SML.RProj'. With the opened R Project, double click on 'RecurrentNeuralNetwork.Rmd' to open the R Markdown File.  
Note: The R Markdown file may take up to 10 minutes to run due to the training of the RNN and LSTM models.
